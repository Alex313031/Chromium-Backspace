Go back with the backspace button! This extension re-enables the backspace key
as a back navigation button -- except if you're writing text.

Before Chrome 52, the backspace key navigated back (if you weren't writing
text). Many people lost their progress while working online by accidentally
pressing backspace and leaving a page -- so we removed the feature from Chrome,
and created this extension for those who prefer the old behavior.

This extension can't restore backspace on certain special pages, for example
any of the "chrome://" pages such as Settings or Extensions, or in the Chrome
Web Store.

About the requested permissions:

"Read and modify all your data": In order to capture backspace on every page,
the extension needs to install a little piece of code on each one, including
tabs that are already open when the extension itself is installed or updated.
It does nothing else with the page, its information, or your typing.

"Manage your apps, extensions, and themes": This lets the extension detect
when it has been re-enabled and install its code into tabs that are already
open then, too.
